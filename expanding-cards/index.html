        <p>
          Dubai is the most populous city in the United Arab Emirates and the
          capital of the Emirate of Dubai, the most populated of the 7 emirates
          of the United Arab Emirates. Established in the 18th century as a
          small fishing village, the city grew rapidly in the early 21st century
          with a focus on tourism and luxury, having the second most five-star
          hotels in the world, and the tallest building in the world, the Burj
          Khalifa, which is 828 metres tall. In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on
          the coast of the Persian Gulf, it is also a major global transport hub
          for passengers and cargo. Oil revenue helped accelerate the
          development of the city, which was already a major mercantile hub.

        <h3>Piburger See, Austria</h3>
        <p>
          Lake Piburger See and the 3,000m high Acherkogel mountain are two
          must-see highlights near the village of Oetz in the Ötztal Valley.
          Dominated by the awe-inspiring Acherkogel mountain high above, the
          Piburger See is a popular destination in summer thanks to its
          beautiful location in the heart of an alpine forest at 900 metres
          above sea level. Despite its altitude, the lake warms up relatively
          quickly in summer to a pleasant 24°C. The Piburger See is an area of
          outstanding natural beauty within the borders of a nature reserve and
          therefore serves as a habitat for many protected species of animals
          and plants.

        <h3>Lake Atitlán, Guatemala</h3>
        <p>
          Lake Atitlan is Guatemala's largest tourist attraction and for good
          reason. The lake and it's views of Volcanos and mountains are
          stunning. There is a lakeside towns to suit everyone; for backpackers
          it is San Pedro, for hippies it is San Marcos, for those who want
          peace and quiet it is Santa Cruz. It is good to stay at different
          towns to experience these different vibes. We stayed at both San Pedro
          and Santa Cruz. There were plenty of activities and restaurants at San
          Pedro. Santa Cruz was more limited, however it had perfect views of
          the San Pedro and Atitlan Volcanoes across the lake and was very
          relaxing. Publico water taxis run frequently and can get you across
          the lake for 25Q or less, with prices varying depending on how far you
          go.

        <h3>Dinant, Belgium</h3>
        <p>
          Dinant is positioned in the Upper Meuse valley, at a point where the
          river cuts deeply into the western Condroz plateau. Sited in a steep
          sided valley, between the rock face and the river. The original
          settlement had little space in which to grow away from the river, and
          it therefore expanded into a long, thin town, on a north-south axis,
          along the river shore. During the 19th century, the former Île des
          Batteurs (Drummers' Island) to the south was attached directly to the
          town when a branch of the Meuse was filled in.
